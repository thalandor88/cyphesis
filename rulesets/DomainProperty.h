 * @brief Specifies that an entity contains a "Domain".
 *
 * This makes the entity responsible for physics and sight checking, effectively giving the entity
 * it's own space.
 * Normally you wouldn't use nested domains, since the effects (currently) are undefined.
 *
 * The data defines the kind of domain. The available options are:
 * * void: no movement or sight allowed
 * * physical: movement and sights behave like in the real world
